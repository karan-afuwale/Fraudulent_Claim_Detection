Problem Statement

Global Insure handles thousands of claims annually, with a significant portion suspected to be fraudulent.
The current approach of manual fraud detection is:
Time-consuming
Often identifies fraud too late, leading to financial losses
There is a critical need for a faster, more efficient system to detect and flag fraudulent claims early in the process, minimizing risk and improving response time.

Business Objective

Develop a predictive model that uses historical claim and customer data to classify claims as fraudulent or legitimate, enabling faster and more accurate fraud detection.
